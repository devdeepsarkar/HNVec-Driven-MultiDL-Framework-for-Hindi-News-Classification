# HNVec-Driven MultiDL Framework for Hindi News Classification

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

A novel deep learning framework for the content-based classification of Hindi news articles, achieving **88.61% accuracy**. [cite_start]This project introduces **HNVec (Hindi News Vectorizer)**, a custom word embedding model tailored for the semantic and contextual nuances of the Hindi language[cite: 92]. [cite_start]It also implements a hybrid learning model (**HLM-CLS**) that combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Logistic Regression (LR) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to achieve high classification accuracy[cite: 94].

This system was developed to address the challenges of text classification for low-resource languages, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline vectorization methods.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* [cite_start]**Custom Hindi Embeddings (HNVec):** A novel, distance-based context-sensitive vectorizer designed specifically to capture the morphological richness of Hindi text[cite: 92, 917].
* [cite_start]**Hybrid Learning Architecture:** A multi-layer model that leverages the feature extraction power of CNNs and the robust classification capabilities of SVM and LR[cite: 94, 880].
* [cite_start]**High Performance:** Achieved an **accuracy of 88.61%** and an F1-score of 88.51% on the test dataset[cite: 97].
* [cite_start]**Comprehensive Preprocessing:** Includes a robust pipeline for cleaning and preparing Hindi text, handling tokenization, stopword removal, and normalization[cite: 628].

## üèõÔ∏è Project Architecture

The framework follows a multi-stage pipeline that integrates feature extraction, feature reduction, and final classification. [cite_start]This hybrid approach is designed to capture complex patterns while maintaining robust classification performance[cite: 882].



**1. Feature Extraction:**
* [cite_start]Input Hindi news articles undergo extensive preprocessing[cite: 628].
* The novel **HNVec vectorizer** converts the text into meaningful, context-aware embeddings.
* [cite_start]Simultaneously, a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** processes the tokenized text to extract high-level features and local patterns[cite: 911].

**2. Feature Combination & Reduction:**
* The features from HNVec and the CNN are combined into a single, enriched feature set.
* This combined set is used to train parallel **Logistic Regression (LR)** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** models. The outputs from these models act as a reduced feature set.

**3. Final Classification:**
* A final **SVM classifier** is trained on this reduced feature set to make the ultimate prediction, categorizing the news article into one of the predefined classes (e.g., Sports, Politics, Entertainment).

## üöÄ Performance & Results

The HLM-CLS model combined with our custom HNVec embeddings delivered the best performance, validating our approach. [cite_start]The proposed model with HNVec provides the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to other combinations[cite: 97].

| Metric    | Score     |
| :-------- | :-------- |
| **Accuracy** | **88.61%** |
| Precision | 88.50%    |
| Recall    | 88.61%    |
| F1-Score  | 88.51%    |

_These results were achieved with a 70:30 train-test split_.

[cite_start]The model showed strong convergence with minimal training loss, indicating that the HNVec-trained model has good generalization without overfitting[cite: 1299].

## üîÆ Future Work

[cite_start]Based on the findings of our research, future extensions of this work could include[cite: 1499]:

* [cite_start]**Handling Hinglish:** Developing models to classify mixed Hindi-English text[cite: 1500].
* [cite_start]**Fine-Grained Classification:** Extending the model to classify news into more specific subcategories (e.g., 'Cricket' within 'Sports')[cite: 1501].
* [cite_start]**Personalized News Delivery:** Using the classification system as a backbone for a personalized news recommendation engine[cite: 1504].
* [cite_start]**Exploring Niche Domains:** Adapting the model for specialized topics like agriculture, finance, or regional development updates[cite: 1502].
